# Plugin System Architecture

## Overview
The plugin system provides a flexible and extensible architecture for adding new functionality to the application. It follows the principles of loose coupling and high cohesion.

## Key Components

### Plugin Manager
- Dynamically loads plugins at runtime
- Manages plugin lifecycle (initialization, execution, cleanup)
- Handles plugin dependencies and conflicts
- Provides plugin registration and discovery

### Event System
- **Event Bus**: 
  - Facilitates asynchronous communication
  - Implements publish-subscribe pattern
  - Supports event filtering and routing
  
- **Event Store**:
  - Persists events for audit and replay
  - Supports event sourcing patterns
  - Enables event replay for debugging

### Plugin Interface
Each plugin must implement:
- Initialization method
- Event handlers
- Cleanup routines
- Configuration management

## Best Practices
1. **Plugin Development**
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include comprehensive documentation
   - Write unit tests for plugin functionality

2. **Event Handling**
   - Use strongly typed events
   - Implement idempotent handlers
   - Handle failures gracefully
   - Log event processing

3. **Configuration**
   - Use environment variables
   - Support runtime configuration
   - Validate plugin settings
   - Document configuration options

## Plugin Lifecycle
1. Discovery and Loading
2. Configuration and Initialization
3. Event Registration
4. Runtime Operation
5. Cleanup and Shutdown

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for each plugin
- Test event handling
- Mock dependencies
- Test configuration handling
- Verify cleanup procedures
