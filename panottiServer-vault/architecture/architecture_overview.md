# Architecture Overview

## Framework and Structure
- **FastAPI** is used as the web framework
- Organized into modules following clean architecture principles:
  - `app/`: Main application code
  - `plugins/`: Plugin system for extensibility
  - `scripts/`: Utility and maintenance scripts
  - `tests/`: Test suite
  - `logs/`: Application logs

## Key Components
- **Models**: Handles data structures and database interactions
- **Plugins**: Manages additional functionalities and event handling
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions and configurations
- **Tests**: Includes comprehensive test suite

## Best Practices Implementation
### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 standards
- Use type hints with `typing` and `pydantic`
- Implement strict linting with `flake8`/`ruff`
- Format code with `black`
- Sort imports with `isort`

### Testing Strategy
- Use `pytest` for testing
- Implement test pyramid approach
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Use fixtures for test setup

### Logging and Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Configurable log levels via environment
- Support for log aggregation
- Performance monitoring capabilities

### Security
- API Key authentication
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure dependency management
- Input validation and sanitization

## Configuration
- Environment variables loaded via `dotenv`
- Centralized configuration management
- Separate dev/prod configurations

## Event System
- Event-driven architecture
- Plugin manager for dynamic loading
- Event bus for inter-component communication
- Persistent event store

## Deployment
- ASGI server (`uvicorn`) based deployment
- Docker support
- Environment-specific configurations
- CORS and middleware setup

## Recommended Improvements
1. Reorganize into `src` directory structure
2. Enhance test organization
3. Add dependency auditing
4. Implement structured logging
5. Expand plugin documentation
