## 1. Executive Summary
This project involves the development of a Python-based API application that receives events for "start recording" and "end recording." The API must adhere to best practices in terms of security, maintainability, and scalability. Swagger documentation will be integrated for easy API exploration and testing.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
- Create a lightweight, efficient, and secure Python application to handle "start recording" and "end recording" events.
- Ensure the API adheres to Python best practices for code quality, documentation, and testing.
- Provide clear and interactive API documentation using Swagger.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:
- Implementation of two API endpoints (POST /start-recording, POST /end-recording)
- Data validation and error handling
- Swagger UI integration for API documentation
- Logging for monitoring events
- Secure handling of API requests

### Out of Scope:
- Frontend UI for triggering these APIs
- Persistent storage beyond basic logs

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

#### Endpoints:
- POST /start-recording: Receives details for starting a recording
- POST /end-recording: Receives details for ending a recording

#### Payload Validation:
- Both endpoints should validate required fields (e.g., session_id, timestamp)

#### Response:
- Standardized JSON responses for success and errors

### Non-Functional Requirements:

#### Performance:
- Each API call must complete within 200ms under normal load

#### Scalability:
- The application should handle up to 100 requests per second

#### Security:
- API authentication using a token-based system (e.g., OAuth2 or API keys)
- Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Documentation:
- Swagger UI for API specifications

## 5. System Architecture
- Framework: FastAPI (lightweight, performance-oriented, with native support for Swagger)
- Database: None (for this scope). Logs will be stored in JSON or plaintext files
- Hosting: AWS Lambda (serverless) or Docker container
- Authentication: Token-based (JWT or API Key)

## 6. Best Practices

### Documentation:
- Use inline comments sparingly
- Create a detailed README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Installation steps
  - Usage examples
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes using the Google style or PEP 257 format

### Security:
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement environment variables for secrets and keys using dotenv or AWS Secrets Manager
- Enable CORS for specified domains
- Validate all incoming payloads strictly with Pydantic models

### Code Quality:
- Adhere to PEP 8
- Structure the project using the following layout:
```
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── routers/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── events.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── event.py
│   ├── tests/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── test_events.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── .env
└── .gitignore
```
- Use static type checking with mypy

### Testing:
- Write unit tests for each endpoint using pytest
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage
- Automate testing with GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools

## 7. API Design

### Endpoints:

#### 1. POST /start-recording
Description: Start recording a session

Payload:
```json
{
    "session_id": "string",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

Response:
- Success: 200 OK
- Error: 400 Bad Request

#### 2. POST /end-recording
Description: End an active recording session

Payload:
```json
{
    "session_id": "string",
    "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

Response:
- Success: 200 OK
- Error: 400 Bad Request

### Swagger Integration:
- Library: Use FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI and Swagger support
- Endpoint: Serve Swagger documentation at /docs

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- API endpoints return appropriate responses for valid and invalid inputs
- Swagger documentation is accessible and correctly describes all endpoints
- The application passes all unit and integration tests

## 9. Assumptions
- Endpoints will primarily receive JSON payloads
- The API will not store data persistently (other than logs)

## 10. Out of Scope
- Advanced analytics or reporting on received events
- Integration with external services (e.g., cloud storage)

## 11. Timeline
- Week 1: Requirements gathering, system architecture design
- Week 2-3: API implementation, Swagger integration
- Week 4: Testing and deployment
