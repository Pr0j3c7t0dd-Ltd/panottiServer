# Pluggy FastAPI Integration PRD

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Goal
The goal is to implement a robust, extensible plugin architecture in the existing FastAPI application using Pluggy. The plugin system should allow new features to be added or modified without changing the core code, encourage a modular design, and enable easy discovery, configuration, and execution of plugins.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Extensibility: Allow integration of third-party features as plugins that can hook into predefined application events and processes.
- Maintainability: Use a standardized framework (Pluggy) that the development community widely supports, ensuring clean abstractions and fewer architectural pitfalls.
- Asynchronous Compatibility: Ensure that the plugin system can handle both synchronous and asynchronous hooks, aligning with FastAPI's async-first model.
- Concurrency & Multi-threading: Support safe execution of CPU-bound or blocking plugin tasks in parallel where necessary, leveraging Python's modern concurrency tools.
- Discoverability: Automatically discover and load plugins from installed Python packages using importlib.metadata entry points.
- Testing & Quality Assurance: Provide a testing strategy using pytest (already included in the requirements), ensuring that plugins and their integration can be validated easily.

## 2. Stakeholders and Users
- Developers: The primary users who will create and maintain plugins. They need a simple, well-documented API to add hooks.
- Operators / DevOps: They may enable or disable plugins via environment variables or configuration files without code changes.
- QA / Testers: Require a straightforward testing setup to validate that plugins integrate well and that no regressions occur in the main application.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Plugin Hook Specifications

#### Hooks Definition
The core application will define a set of hook specifications (e.g., on_startup, on_shutdown, before_request, after_request, authentication_hook, etc.).

#### Hook Types
- Synchronous hooks: For simple, fast operations.
- Asynchronous hooks: For I/O-bound tasks that integrate with FastAPI's event loop.

#### Parameter & Return Types
Each hook specification should define clear input parameters and expected return types. For example:

```python
# In a hookspec file (e.g., hookspec.py)
import pluggy

hookspec = pluggy.HookspecMarker("myapp")

class MyAppSpecs:
    @hookspec
    async def on_startup(app) -> None:
        """Run any startup logic, given the FastAPI app instance."""

    @hookspec
    async def before_request(request) -> None:
        """Run logic before a request is processed."""

    @hookspec
    async def after_request(response) -> None:
        """Run logic after a request is processed."""

    @hookspec
    async def on_shutdown(app) -> None:
        """Run cleanup logic during shutdown."""
```

### 3.2 Plugin Registration and Discovery

#### Entry Points
Plugins will register themselves using Python entry points in their pyproject.toml or setup.cfg. For example:

```toml
[project.entry-points."myapp"]
myplugin = "myplugin_package:MyPlugin"
```

#### Dynamic Loading
On application startup, use importlib.metadata.entry_points() to load all entry points under the myapp group. Instantiate and register them with a Pluggy PluginManager.

### 3.3 Plugin Manager Setup

#### Plugin Manager Initialization
The application will create a single PluginManager instance at startup:

```python
import pluggy
from myapp.hookspec import MyAppSpecs

pm = pluggy.PluginManager("myapp")
pm.add_hookspecs(MyAppSpecs)
```

#### Plugin Registration
The application will discover and register plugins:

```python
from importlib.metadata import entry_points

for entry_point in entry_points(group="myapp"):
    plugin = entry_point.load()
    pm.register(plugin)
```

### 3.4 Hook Invocation

#### Invoking Hooks
Whenever the main application triggers a lifecycle event or a request-related event, it calls the corresponding hooks:

```python
await pm.hook.on_startup(app=app)
# ... handle requests ...
await pm.hook.before_request(request=request)
response = await handler(request)
await pm.hook.after_request(response=response)
```

#### Async Support
Hooks can be async. The pm.hook.* calls will need to be awaited if the hooks are async functions. Pluggy can handle async by using an async wrapper or custom calling logic. Consider using anyio or asyncio features to parallelize async hooks if needed.

### 3.5 Concurrency and Multi-Threading

#### Context and Use Cases
For CPU-bound plugin tasks (e.g., heavy computation), allow running hooks in a thread pool using concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio.to_thread():

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

async def run_in_thread(fn, *args, **kwargs):
    return await asyncio.to_thread(fn, *args, **kwargs)
```

#### Best Practices
- Avoid global mutable state in plugins if they are run concurrently.
- Document thread-safety or state management requirements for plugin developers.
- If plugins need shared resources, provide thread-safe or async-friendly abstractions.

### 3.6 Configuration and Enabling/Disabling Plugins

#### Config Files / Env Vars
Allow toggling plugins via environment variables or configuration files. For example, if a plugin's name is myplugin, you could have ENABLE_MYPLUGIN=false to skip its registration.

#### Selective Loading
Before calling pm.register(plugin), check configuration to decide if that plugin should be loaded.

### 3.7 Error Handling and Logging

#### Isolation of Failures
If one plugin hook fails, it should log an error and not necessarily halt the entire application. The PluginManager can be configured to catch and report exceptions.

#### Logging
Log plugin loading, enabling, disabling, and hook execution timing to help diagnose issues.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Hooks should execute quickly. If long-running tasks are needed, use async I/O, thread pools, or background tasks.
- Loading and registering plugins at startup should not significantly delay the server boot time.

### 4.2 Security
- Evaluate plugin code trustworthiness. Consider running plugins in isolated processes if needed.
- Validate plugin signatures if they provide sensitive logic, especially around authentication hooks.

### 4.3 Scalability
- The architecture should scale as more plugins are added. Use consistent naming and grouping to avoid conflicts.
- Support horizontal scaling of the FastAPI app with Gunicorn workers. Each worker loads plugins independently.

## 5. Technical Details

### 5.1 Tools and Libraries
- Pluggy: For the core plugin architecture.
- importlib.metadata: For plugin discovery via entry points.
- asyncio / anyio: For async operations and concurrency.
- concurrent.futures / asyncio.to_thread: For CPU-bound operations in thread pools.
- pytest: For testing. Pytest already integrates well with Pluggy.

### 5.2 Directory Structure
A suggested structure:

```
myapp/
  __init__.py
  main.py
  hookspec.py       # Defines the hook specifications
  plugin_manager.py # Setup and initialization of the plugin manager
  plugins/          # Internal plugins can live here (optional)
tests/
  test_plugins.py    # Tests for plugin loading and hook execution
```

### 5.3 Example Plugin
A minimal plugin might look like this:

```python
# myplugin_package/__init__.py
import pluggy

hookimpl = pluggy.HookimplMarker("myapp")

class MyPlugin:
    @hookimpl
    async def on_startup(self, app):
        print("MyPlugin: on_startup hook called")

    @hookimpl
    async def before_request(self, request):
        print("MyPlugin: before_request hook called")
```

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Test hook registration, invocation, async hook handling, and error handling.

### Integration Tests
Run the FastAPI app with test plugins enabled. Use pytest and httpx to simulate requests, ensuring that hooks are called.

### Performance Tests
Optional load testing with multiple plugins enabled to ensure performance is acceptable.

## 7. Rollout and Deployment

### Phased Rollout
Introduce the plugin system in a feature branch. Test thoroughly in a staging environment.

### Documentation
- Provide developer documentation and examples for writing plugins.
- Update readmes and internal wikis to explain how to enable/disable and configure plugins.

### Monitoring & Logging
- Monitor logs for plugin hook execution times and errors.
- Consider exposing plugin states via a health endpoint.

## 8. Maintenance and Future Work

### Lifecycle Management
Add versioning for hooks. If a hook signature changes, maintain backward compatibility or provide migration paths.

### Security Enhancements
If untrusted plugins are a concern, consider sandboxing or restricting plugin capabilities.

### Distribution
Support plugin packages on private or public PyPI indexes.

## 9. Approval & Sign-off
- Engineering Lead: Approved pending successful test results.
- QA Lead: Approved with test coverage above a predetermined threshold (e.g., 85% coverage).
- Product Management: Approved as it adds extensibility and reduces maintenance overhead for future features.
