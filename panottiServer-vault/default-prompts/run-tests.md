- run the tests with `xcodebuild test -scheme PanottiAudio -destination 'platform=macOS'`
- Only fix one error at a time, then run the tests after each fix. Don't add more tests.
- If you encounter any errors, fix them one by one.
- Run the acceptance tests again after each fix to verify that the issue has been fixed.
- Continue this process until you have fixed all the issues.
