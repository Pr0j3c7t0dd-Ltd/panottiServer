- check the code by running `mvn checkstyle:check`
- fix the issues in the code, one file at a time
- check the code after each fix to verify that the issue has been fixed
- continue this process until you have fixed all the issues
- ignore any line length issues, do not fix them 

DO NOT add any tests or new code, only fix the style issues!
