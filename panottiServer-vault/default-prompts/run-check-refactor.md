- Analyze the entire @codebase to see if there are any areas that could be refactored or improved. If so, please refactor or improve them.
- When refactoring, make sure you are not breaking any existing functionality. Don't add any new features, just refactor.
- When refactoring, you can create new files, such as new libraries or utilities, but you should not change the existing functionality.
- When you are done refactoring or improving the codebase, run `pytest` to ensure that your changes have not broken any existing functionality.
