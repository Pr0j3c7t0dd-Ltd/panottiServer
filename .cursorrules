# Python Best Practices for Enterprise-Grade Applications

This document outlines best practices, coding standards, and recommendations for professional Python applications, including tools for testing, monitoring, logging, observability, and file structure.

## General Guidelines

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

ALWAYS consult the files in @panottiServer-vault/architecture folder for the best practices.  Update the files in @panottiServer-vault/architecture folder or add new files as necessary to capture the latest architecture.

### Description
Ensure adherence to clean code principles, maintainability, and scalability.

### Best Practices
- Follow **PEP 8** standards for code style and formatting
- Use **type hints** for function signatures and variables (e.g., `typing` or `pydantic`)
- Enforce strict linting with tools like **flake8**, **pylint**, or **ruff**
- Adopt auto-formatting tools like **black** for consistent formatting
- Use **isort** to organize imports alphabetically and separate standard, third-party, and local imports

## File Structure

### Description
Use a modular and scalable structure for the project.

### Recommended Layout
```

├── src/
│   ├── module1/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── services.py
│   │   ├── routes.py
│   │   └── tests/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── test_module1.py
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── logging_config.py

```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Overview
- The application uses **FastAPI** as the framework.
- Organized into modules: `models`, `plugins`, `utils`, and `tests`.

### Key Components
- **Models**: Data structures and database interactions.
- **Plugins**: Additional functionalities and event handling.
- **Utils**: Utility functions like logging configuration.

### Best Practices
- Maintain a modular structure for scalability and maintainability.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Implement API Key security for endpoints.

## Plugin Management

### Overview
- Plugins are used to extend application functionality and handle events.

### Best Practices
- Use a **Plugin Manager** to dynamically load and manage plugins.
- Ensure plugins are well-documented and tested.
- Facilitate communication through an **Event Bus** and persist events with an **Event Store**.

## Testing

### Description
Ensure thorough testing with a preference for automation.

### Best Practices
- Use **pytest** for testing, and integrate plugins like:
  - `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
  - `pytest-mock` for mocking
- Follow the **Test Pyramid** approach: prioritize unit tests, followed by integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests
- Use `conftest.py` for shared test configurations
- Generate test data with **factory_boy** or **pytest-factoryboy**
- Write fixtures for reusable setup logic
- Integrate tests with CI pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, or **GitLab CI/CD**

## Logging

### Description
Establish centralized, structured, and easily configurable logging.

### Best Practices
- Use **structlog** for structured and JSON-based logging
- Configure logging settings in a `logging_config.py` file and manage log levels with environment variables
- Aggregate logs using:
  - ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - SaaS providers like **Datadog** or **Sentry**
- Use **correlation IDs** to trace requests across services

## Observability

### Description
Integrate monitoring, tracing, and metrics collection.

### Best Practices
- Use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and instrumentation
- Export telemetry data to:
  - **Prometheus/Grafana**
  - SaaS platforms like **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **Honeycomb**
- Monitor application performance with APM tools like **Elastic APM** or **Datadog**
- Collect and visualize metrics for business and system indicators

## Dependency Management

### Description
Ensure dependency stability and consistency.

### Best Practices
- Use **poetry** or **pip-tools** for dependency management
- Pin dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using:
  - **safety**
  - **dependabot**

## Security

### Description
Adopt secure coding practices and tools.

### Best Practices
- Use **Bandit** for static analysis of security vulnerabilities
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like **Snyk** or **pip-audit**
- Follow OWASP best practices for input validation and authentication
