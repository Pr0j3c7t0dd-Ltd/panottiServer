# Python Best Practices for Enterprise-Grade Applications

This document outlines best practices, coding standards, and recommendations for professional Python applications, including tools for testing, monitoring, logging, observability, and file structure.

## General Guidelines

### Description
Ensure adherence to clean code principles, maintainability, and scalability.

### Best Practices
- Follow **PEP 8** standards for code style and formatting
- Use **type hints** for function signatures and variables (e.g., `typing` or `pydantic`)
- Enforce strict linting with tools like **flake8**, **pylint**, or **ruff**
- Adopt auto-formatting tools like **black** for consistent formatting
- Use **isort** to organize imports alphabetically and separate standard, third-party, and local imports

## File Structure

### Description
Use a modular and scalable structure for the project.

### Recommended Layout
```
project_name/
├── src/
│   ├── module1/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py
│   │   ├── services.py
│   │   ├── routes.py
│   │   └── tests/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── test_module1.py
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── logging_config.py
│   │   ├── utils.py
│   │   └── config.py
│   └── tests/
│       ├── conftest.py
│       ├── test_integration/
│       └── test_unit/
├── scripts/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── data_processing.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── .env
```

## Testing

### Description
Ensure thorough testing with a preference for automation.

### Best Practices
- Use **pytest** for testing, and integrate plugins like:
  - `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
  - `pytest-mock` for mocking
- Follow the **Test Pyramid** approach: prioritize unit tests, followed by integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests
- Use `conftest.py` for shared test configurations
- Generate test data with **factory_boy** or **pytest-factoryboy**
- Write fixtures for reusable setup logic
- Integrate tests with CI pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **CircleCI**, or **GitLab CI/CD**

## Logging

### Description
Establish centralized, structured, and easily configurable logging.

### Best Practices
- Use **structlog** for structured and JSON-based logging
- Configure logging settings in a `logging_config.py` file and manage log levels with environment variables
- Aggregate logs using:
  - ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - SaaS providers like **Datadog** or **Sentry**
- Use **correlation IDs** to trace requests across services

## Observability

### Description
Integrate monitoring, tracing, and metrics collection.

### Best Practices
- Use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and instrumentation
- Export telemetry data to:
  - **Prometheus/Grafana**
  - SaaS platforms like **Datadog**, **New Relic**, or **Honeycomb**
- Monitor application performance with APM tools like **Elastic APM** or **Datadog**
- Collect and visualize metrics for business and system indicators

## Dependency Management

### Description
Ensure dependency stability and consistency.

### Best Practices
- Use **poetry** or **pip-tools** for dependency management
- Pin dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using:
  - **safety**
  - **dependabot**

## Security

### Description
Adopt secure coding practices and tools.

### Best Practices
- Use **Bandit** for static analysis of security vulnerabilities
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like **Snyk** or **pip-audit**
- Follow OWASP best practices for input validation and authentication

## Frameworks

### Description
Leverage modern frameworks for web and API development.

### Recommendations
- Use **FastAPI** for API development due to its performance, developer experience, and Pydantic integration
- For full-stack applications, consider:
  - **Django** for its batteries-included approach
  - **Flask** for lightweight applications with extensions as needed
- Use **SQLAlchemy** or **Tortoise-ORM** for database interactions
